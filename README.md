# DDPG

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. DDPG is an off-policy actor-critic algorithm designed for continuous action spaces, combining the benefits of DPG and DQN.

For a detailed understanding of DDPG, you can refer to the original research paper by Lillicrap et al.:
[Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971).
